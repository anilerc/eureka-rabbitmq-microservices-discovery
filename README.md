# eureka-spring-kafka-microservices

In this project, I am honing my Java/Spring microservices skills by communicating fraud detection, customer and notification microservices (Kafka) with Eureka Service Discovery, Spring Cloud OpenFeign, Web MVC and many more. 

Start date is 20.10.2023. My aims for the next iterations are:

- Enable distributed tracing
- Enable Kafka or RabbitMQ for async communication with the notifications service
- Migrate current Eureka architecture to Kubernetes / Linode.

Following N-tier, layered architecture for a clean architecture throughout the repository.

As I further improve, I will also refactor to better solutions (i.e. switching from RestTemplate to OpenFeign).
